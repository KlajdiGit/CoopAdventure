## Description
CoopAdventure is a multiplayer game built with Unreal Engine 5. The game is set in an ancient Egypt-like scene where two players work together to find three keys to open a pyramid in order to reach the finish line to win the game.

## Gameplay
When launching the game, players are presented with a menu where they can create or join a server. The game is designed for two players who must combine their skills to collect the keys. 

Keys are collected by using movable platforms, which can be activated when one player stands on particular trigger platforms connected to that movable platform, allowing the other player to move. After collecting all three keys, players can enter the pyramid and navigate to the win area to complete the game.
